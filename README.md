# HR_Attrition_API_and_Docker

*If you haven't yet solved the Human Resources Attrition use case, please jump in [this link](https://github.com/BI4ALL/ml-usecase-classification-humanresourcesattrition) and come back after you finished!*

# Introduction
After fine tunning your model and when you feel it is ready to be used, you want to make it available for your client or work colleagues.

In order to do that, you must **create an API** to input new data into your model and get back the results, and **create a docker container** with all the files needed for a client to run and test your model.

# Goals

The purpose of this use case is for you to study and analyse the properties of APIs and docker files, and turn the *Human Resources Attrition model* available for external use.

The use case is divided in two paths: ["`1_FastAPI`"](https://github.com/lduarte-bi4all/HR_Attrition_API_and_Docker/tree/main/1_FastAPI) and ["`2_Docker`"](https://github.com/lduarte-bi4all/HR_Attrition_API_and_Docker/tree/main/2_Docker). Both folders have a `README` file that you should read and follow carefully. There are a few links with external information for you to consolidate. You should always try to create a solution by yourself, but dive into the `src` folder if you get into a dead-end situation.

If you feel like you already know how to use this features, go ahead and try to solve this use case by yourself.

### Good Luck ;)
