This is a simple definition of *docker*. You shoud go along [this official guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) and learn how to install and use its features.

To get familiarized, run a *docker* container from [this *Hello-World* image](https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world).

The *Dockerfile* must be in the same directory of the API as you can see in `src` file.
